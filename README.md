## General Information

--The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). 

-- All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

-- The data base was loaded into the google drive and further collaborated with Colabs.

-- Used GPU towards the betterment of the model execution.  


## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 : Using earlystop function would stop the firther propogation of epochs when thers is not enhancement in the performance.
- Conclusion 2 : The model gets improved.
- Conclusion 3 : Better prediction 




## Technologies Used: Google Colabs
-- Tensorflow and Keras 
-- library - Latest versions from google colabs were used.
